Kitayama Shouko
===============

Hello, my name is a secret but you can call me Kitayama, Shouko, Kitayama Shouko, etc.

I like to develop some tools and write some scripts.

I can speak English and Chinese. Although I am not good at English, I can try to use that to communicate with others.

I usually use traditional Chinese to write the message, but I can read simplified Chinese.
